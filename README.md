DM me on discord (zruxr#5923) for paid version source code.


Valorant account checker. Proxy doesnt work rn, you can fix it ig. 

You need to pip install requests, random, os, sys, time, ctypes, threading, easygui, datetime, webbrowser, shutil, fileinput, os.path, traceback, readchar, json, cloudscraper, pandas, ssl, string, colorama, Fore, Back, init, InquirerPy, inquirer, get_style, discord_webhook, DiscordWebhook, DiscordEmbed. BUT you should have most of these already. Might have to install more depending on what error it spits out.



Features:

> Proxyless Checking
> Full Capture
> One Line Checker (kinda broken, need to bulk check first)
> Webhook
> Proxy Checking (broken)
